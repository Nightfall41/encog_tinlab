\section{Managing}

\subsection{Is able to independently manage a project and when its necessary adjust project based on the correct substantiation}

We managed this project with the open source software Git. Git is a version control software and it is very handy when working on code between 2 or more developers. 
\\\\
We had in the beginning a git repository called "encogje". Because of documentation and library problems we moved on to a new project. There we made a new repository called "encog tinlab" and build it on top of the old one. I used git the whole semester and i personally think that i have achieved this competence.
\section{Analysing}
\subsection{can independently solve the problem based on contact with the client
define research questions, determine scope and appropriate
prepare quality requirements with regard to code, the product itself and the
use of the product}

During the whole project the requirements of the end product were already been known. The end product end and the code are all as the requirement asked.

\subsection{Is able to draw conclusion based on literature and experimental research}
During the semester we had bookclubs. With those bookclubs you had to read a lot of scientific papers and making questions out of it. During those bookkclub i got a lot of information about ale of topics about machine learning. During the development of the end product i had to research about different algorithms.
I personally think that i achieved this competence.


\section{Advising}

\subsection{Being able to advise the client in an appropriate manner about the results and
conclusions of the investigation}

In main report we have given advice about the product. The advisement's are based on research and realising the the prototype. I think i achieved this competence.

\section{Designing}

\subsection{Being able to draw up relevant designs based on self-defined requirements}

We have en UML diagram of our source code and we have a system-architecture. Both are based on the product we build. So i personally think that i achieved this competence as well.

\section{Realizing}

\subsection{Able to realise a working and demonstrably tested prototype in
accordance with the designs and quality requirements}
 We have realised the prototype as it was described and it meets the requirements that was determined in the beginning of the project. Because we realised it with success i personally think that i achieved this competence too.
